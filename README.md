# AquaPack Robotics Control Board

The control board is a replacement for the Cube Orange / Pixhawk running ArduSub that was originally used on SeaWolf VIII. The control board was developed to address continuous issues with both control and sensors when using either off the shelf autopilot.

The control board is designed using development boards and breakout boards to reduce development time and simplify maintenance / modifications later. This is not a size-optimized solution (and does not need to be).

The control board generates ESC control signals (PWM), acquires and processes sensor data (using onboard IMU / IMUs, depth sensor, and sensor fusion / filtering algorithms) as well as running control loops for system motion and stability control. Additionally, an interface to the computer (Jetson) is provided to acquire sensor data and allow control of motors using high or low level methods (vectored motion or direct control of each motorâ€™s speed)/


## Components

- Adafruit ItsyBitsy M4 Express Development Board
    - Cortex M4 CPU capable of 32-bit integer math and includes hardware multiplier and divider
    - Cortext M4 CPU has a hardware floating point unit
    - The above two features help reduce software complexity making the firmware easier to maintain, debug, and develop
- Adafruit BNO055 Breakout
    - 9DOF IMU (Gyro + Accel + Mag) with good quality sensors
    - Includes an on-chip processor running sensor fusion algorithms and can provide useful information such as a gravity vector or an orientation in 3D space.
    - These features remove the need to develop sensor calibration, fusion, and interpretation algorithms in the control board firmware (simplifies firmware and accelerates development time)
    - Can also provide raw sensor data meaning custom algorithms are still possible if deemed necessary / beneficial at a later time
- Adafruit BMP280 Breakout
    - Pressure and temperature sensor
    - Not likely to be used if on-chip calibrations of BNO055 are used, however some sensor calibration algorithms take into account temperature and pressure. This is present in case this information is needed at a later date.
    - Can also be used to detect abnormal conditions (eg over temperature)


## Assembly

Prototype is assembled on protoboard. Final assembled prototype is shown below.

### Assembly Instructions

1. Solder header strips in the positions shown below. The female headers avoid soldering breakouts / dev boards directly to protoboard which allows easily replacing components if needed (or reusing them for other purposes later). After soldering, breakouts can be populated to make identifying pins easier.

2. Wire SDA and SCL wires from MCU board to each sensor as shown below (connect the two pins shown in each row).
