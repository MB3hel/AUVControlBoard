- Depth sensor read PROM is 8 transactions, not 1...
- Instead of periodically recalculating speeds in global mode, use a timer. This way, if setpoint is changing rapidly from computer recalculate will be skipped.
- Configuration of axes via commands
- Better read rate on BNO055
- Command to start / stop periodically sending IMU data to computer
- Depth sensor code (and i2c0 sharing)
- Command to start / stop periodically sending depth data to computer
- Stability assist mode
- Possible communication protocol changes (ACK of commands to control board)
- Calibration of depth sensor (initial in-air reading for zero depth)
- Move BNO055 existence verification to state machine
- Add status query to read sensor status (connected / not connected)
- Firmware should work without sensor(s) connected excluding modes using the sensor(s)
