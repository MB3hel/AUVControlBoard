# AUV Control Board v2

## Components

- WeAct Studio STM32F411 Black Pill (v3.0)
    - Cortex M4 CPU clocked at 100MHz. Includes hardware FPU.
    - Can buy these from Adafruit's store. If buying from other sources, be careful of counterfeit boards using different (wrong) or counterfeit (often not fully functional) chips.
- Adafruit BNO055 Breakout
    - 9DOF IMU (Gyro + Accel + Mag) with good quality sensors. Includes an on-chip processor running sensor fusion algorithms.
    - *Note that the Stemma QT version has a different pinout. Keep this in mind if using this variant of the breakout board.*
- ProtoBoard (24 by 18) **not stripboard** (rows should not be connected)
- Solid core wire (22 AWG)
- Female pin headers (can carefully cut if necessary)
    - Two 1x20 headers
    - One 1x6 header
    - One 1x4 header
- Male pin headers (can cut)
    - Two 1x8 headers
    - One 1x4 header
- Two 10K resistors (through hole, 1/4 W)
