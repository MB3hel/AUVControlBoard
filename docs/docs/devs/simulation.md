# Simulation

## Simulation Overview

- Real control board over UART
- SimCB over TCP
- Simualtor models environment and provides inputs to control board and retreives outputs from control board
- Can also do this with SimCB! Simulator is a "man in the middle"

## Simulation Support in Firmware

TODO: Simhijack and support for this in firmware (including multiple sensor stuff)


## Building Firmware as SimCB Binaries

TODO: Including required tools, commands, NO CROSS COMPILE, etc
