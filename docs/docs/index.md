# AUV Control Board Documentation

AUV Control Board is a low-cost open-source motion controller for (Autonomous) Underwater Vehicles. It is designed for vehicles with fixed position thrusters and supports motion in 6 degrees of freedom.

There are currently two versions of control board. Neither version has more features than the other. Version 2 was developed to be able to use a different chip / board that was easier to get.

- Version 1 uses an Adafruit ItsyBitsy M4 (Microchip ATSAMD51 chip)
- Version 2 use a WeAct Studio Black Pill (STMicroelectronics STM32F4)

The firmware is capable of running on both versions.
